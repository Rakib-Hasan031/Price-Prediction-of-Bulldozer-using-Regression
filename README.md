üèóÔ∏è Price-Prediction-of-Bulldozer-using-Regression
This project aims to predict the sale prices of bulldozers using a machine learning regression model. By leveraging historical data, the project identifies patterns and factors that influence pricing, enabling more accurate and data-driven pricing predictions.


Bulldozer Price Prediction Project üèóÔ∏è

This repository contains an example machine learning project aimed at predicting the sale price of bulldozers using their characteristics and historical sales data.
Problem Definition

How well can we predict the future sale price of a bulldozer, given its characteristics and previous examples of how much similar bulldozers have been sold for?
Data

The dataset used for this project comes from the Kaggle competition: Bluebook for Bulldozers.
Main Datasets:

    Train.csv:
    The training set, containing data through the end of 2011.

    Valid.csv:
    The validation set, containing data from January 1, 2012 - April 30, 2012.
    Predictions are made on this set during the competition. This dataset is used to generate the public leaderboard score.

    Test.csv:
    The test set, containing data from May 1, 2012 - November 2012.
    This set is released in the last week of the competition, and your score on this set determines the final competition ranking.

Evaluation Metric

The evaluation metric for this project is RMSLE (Root Mean Squared Log Error) between the actual and predicted auction prices.

For more details, visit the competition's evaluation page.
Note:

The primary goal is to minimize the RMSLE, as with most regression problems, the objective is to minimize error.
Goal

Build a machine learning model that predicts bulldozer prices with the lowest possible RMSLE.
Getting Started

    Download the dataset from Kaggle Bluebook for Bulldozers.
    Clone this repository to your local machine.
    Follow the project steps in the notebook to preprocess the data, train the model, and evaluate the results.
